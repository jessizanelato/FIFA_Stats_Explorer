## Focus Topics

* Flask REST API and Web Development
* Web-scraping
* Plotting in the browser

## Overview
A small side-project for some practice with a few skills.

Websites like FUTWIZ and Futhead provide information on in-game statistics of all Ultimate Team players. While you can compare stats of players, this is restricted to raw numbers on 40 different statistics. It can be difficult to make the right choice on which player to spend money on if you want to take a broad range of statistics or more than 2 or 3 players into consideration.

This simple app solves this problem by providing a quick and easy way to visualise and compare player statistics. Currently, one statistic can be compared across 8 players at once in a bar chart, with plans to include scatter plots for two statistics at once, and radar charts for 3-8 statistics at once.

## Changelog
